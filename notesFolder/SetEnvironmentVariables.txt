Permanent Environment Variables

If you want these environment variables to be set automatically for every terminal session,
 you should add them to your shell profile file. For example, add them to .bashrc

nano ~/.bashrc

export MYSQL_HOST=localhost
export MYSQL_USER=root
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=Fishboy@27!
export MYSQL_DATABASE=nba_data_from_playwright

Save and close the file (Ctrl+O to write out and Ctrl+X to exit in nano).

Reload the profile file to apply the changes:
source ~/.bashrc
